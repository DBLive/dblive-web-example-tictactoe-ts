# DBLive Web Example
Example of web app using DBLive to synchronize play of a Tic-Tac-Toe game across multiple devices.

This is obviously **not** a full-featured Tic-Tac-Toe game; you can play both X and O from the same device, or separate, and other people might be playing the game at the same time. The point of this example is to demonstrate how data stays synchronized between devices using DBLive, and how it could work for your project.
